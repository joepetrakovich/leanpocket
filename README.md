## LeanPocket:  A LeanKit Client

LeanPocket is an Android app that implements many methods of the LeanKit API to allow
users to view and interact with their LeanKit boards.

## 2021 Update:

This app has been removed from Google Play as I have no more time to keep it updated.  Leankit has completely deprecated the API that this app was built around so it no longer functions.  

I started to upgrade it to their new V2 APIs (you can see this on the develop branch).  Please feel free to continue this effort!  

The remaining pieces are to get the update card endpoint implemented, and to migrate to the newer authentication method.
