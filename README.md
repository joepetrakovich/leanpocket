## LeanPocket:  A LeanKit Client

LeanPocket is an Android app that implements many methods of the LeanKit API to allow
users to view and interact with their LeanKit boards.

LeanPocket was my second run into Android development ([Media Remote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appshroom.mediaremote) being my first).
