##LeanPocket:  A LeanKit Client

LeanPocket is an Android app that implements many methods of the LeanKit API to allow
users to view and interact with their LeanKit boards.

LeanPocket was my second run into Android development ([Media Remote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appshroom.mediaremote) being my first).

This app does not implement the full LeanKit API and as it grew, it took on some slight spaghetti code to the main activity.  It stands now as a comparison point to my reimplementation of it (see [leanpocket-reboot]()), using MVP and other modern software practices.
